This code started life as the userland tools from rpi, specifically
RaspiVideoYUV. A bunch of features were removed (like demo mode, gps
integration, etc.), and it was turned into a library that provides a
dead-simple interface to access rpi's mmal-based camera (see
rpi_video.h).

A demonstration application, rpi_apriltag_demo.c, is provided to show
how to put apriltags and rpi_video together. Almost any real-world
application would need to modify this demo to actually *do* something
with the detected tags.

On input images 1280x720, 10 fps are achievable with a decimation of 2
on a raspberry pi 4.

To make this work:

1) First build the apriltag distribution in the enclosing foldder.
2) Type 'make' in the rpi folder.
3) There is no step three.
